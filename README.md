##Books REST API:

This project is a simple REST API developed using Node.js and Express to manage a list of books. The main goal of this project was to understand how RESTful services work and how different HTTP methods are used to perform CRUD operations.

The API allows users to:
Retrieve all books (GET)

Add a new book (POST)

Update an existing book by ID (PUT)

Delete a book by ID (DELETE)

Each book contains an id, title, and author. The data is stored in memory using a JavaScript array, so no database is required. Since the storage is in memory, restarting the server will reset the data.
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Express routing, middleware (express.json()), handling request parameters and request bodies, and working with HTTP status codes. It helped me build a strong foundation in backend development and REST API design.
